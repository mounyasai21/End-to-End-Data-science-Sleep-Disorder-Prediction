Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Sleep disorders affect millions of people worldwide, leading to serious health issues such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and poor sleep quality. Early detection of these disorders can help in proper medical intervention and lifestyle modifications. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having a sleep disorder based on various lifestyle, health, and demographic factors.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information such as sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, BMI, and other health indicators to predict whether a person has a sleep disorder. The main objectives include:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handle missing values, normalize numerical data, and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identify patterns and correlations between sleep disorders and features like age, gender, occupation, and BMI.
Feature Selection & Engineering â€“ Extract relevant features that contribute to sleep disorders.
Machine Learning Model Development â€“ Train and evaluate classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Optimization â€“ Tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Performance Evaluation â€“ Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.
ðŸ“Œ Why is Sleep Disorder Prediction Important?
âœ” Early Diagnosis â€“ Helps individuals recognize sleep-related issues before they become severe.
âœ” Improved Healthcare â€“ Assists doctors in diagnosing and treating patients effectively.
âœ” Better Lifestyle Recommendations â€“ Provides insights on improving sleep habits based on key factors.
âœ” Reduced Health Risks â€“ Prevents long-term conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues.

ðŸ“‘ Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

Gender, Age, and Occupation â€“ Demographic details influencing sleep patterns.
Sleep Duration & Quality of Sleep â€“ Measures how long and how well a person sleeps.
Physical Activity & Stress Levels â€“ Key factors affecting sleep health.
BMI & Heart Rate â€“ Indicators of potential sleep-related issues.
Daily Steps & Blood Pressure â€“ Additional lifestyle factors impacting sleep.
Sleep Disorder Label â€“ The target variable indicating whether a person has a sleep disorder or not.
ðŸ”¹ Model Selection & Evaluation
Multiple machine learning classification models will be tested, including:
âœ” Logistic Regression â€“ For basic binary classification.
âœ” Random Forest Classifier â€“ For better accuracy and feature importance analysis.
âœ” Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€“ To separate classes efficiently.
âœ” Gradient Boosting Models â€“ For improved predictive power.

After training, models will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to determine the best-performing model.
